# SeleniumDemo
ðŸ§ª Automated test demo of a banking application built with Selenium (Java) and Cucumber.
This project was created in a short time as a demonstration of my ability to write automated tests and my eagerness to learn.
It was positively received by a senior developer I showed it to, but was not further developed due to a lack of interest from management.
The code is not maintained â€“ it serves as a personal proof of concept.
